                Significant parts of block-jsons.js are taken from

                <strong>Supported types:</strong>
                .bloxdschem, .schematic, .schem, .litematic

                It is recommended to use 
                <a href="https://beta.cubical.xyz">beta cubical</a>
                to convert .schematic files to .schem (File -> Export File -> Sponge Schematic) for more accurate conversion.
            </div>
            <div>Blocks with no equivalent are being replaced with dirt.</div>

            <strong>Splitting Info:</strong>
            <div>Minecraft Schematics that exceed bloxd's maximum chunk size get split into multiple files, compressed into a single .zip file.</div>
            <div>The X-Coordinate specified at the end each file name represents the amount of blocks the build has to be moved on the X-Axis, compared to the position of the first schematic.</div>
            <div>The Y- and Z-Coordinates stay the same.</div>

            <div>
                <strong>Note:</strong>
                I've realised that .bloxdschem to .schem is quite buggy, but I cba to fix it, as I don't want to keep working on this project. Feel free to make your own fixed version of this, just credit me if you do.
